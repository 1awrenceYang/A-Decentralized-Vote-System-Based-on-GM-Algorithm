## Who are we?

We are currently junior college students of ShanDong University of China, we are now attending the The 7th National Cryptography Contest as a team. The team members are: XiangZhengZhao(team leader), WengLiWang, HaoYangZhang. The team is named: Find a Girlfriend with XZgg :) since our team leader XiangZhengZhao is looking for his girlfriend.



## What is this project?

This is our entries to attend The 7th National Cryptography Contest. The project is literally a secure vote system consists of some GM algorithm(China's own approved cryptography algorithm,pretty much like those approved by NIST). We have used SM2 Homomorphic encryption, SM2 Ring Signature, SM3 Hash Function, VRF Verifiable function, Chaum-Pedersen ZKP to construct a Decentralized Secure Vote System.

## How can I run this project?

The project requires 2 following components to run: 

1. **Qt GUI framework**
2. **Miracl library**

First, you need to implement the ***Miracl library*** on your device, if you want to use the static library we built, click [here](https://github.com/1awrenceYang/A-Decentralized-Vote-System-Based-on-GM-Algorithm/blob/Release-Version-1.1/miracl.lib), if you want to build from a scratch, visit the [Miracl Offical Site](https://github.com/miracl/MIRACL/blob/master/docs/miracl-explained/reference-manual/advanced-arithmetic-routines.md)

Second, you need to implement the ***Qt Gui Framework*** , on how to build the framwork, click [here](https://www.qt.io/zh-cn/), the version we used is 5.15.2 so it's recommended not to use a lower version.

Third, if you want to run this project on ***Visual Studio***, please instatll the ***Qt Vs Tool***, it helps you build projects on ***Visual Studio***, [download site](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-vs-tools-for-visual-studio-2022), please be advised that we use ***Visual Studio 2019*** for development, the ***platform tool set*** of Visual Studio is ***Visual Studio 2019 v142*** with C++ 14 standard.
