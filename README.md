## Who are we?

We are currently junior college students of ShanDong University of China, we are now attending the The 7th National Cryptography Contest as a team. The team members are: XiangZhengZhao(team leader), WengLiWang, HaoYangZhang. The team is named: Find a Girlfriend with XZgg :) since our team leader XiangZhengZhao is looking for his girlfriend.



## What is this project?

This is our entries to attend The 7th National Cryptography Contest. The project is literally a secure vote system consists of some GM algorithm(China's own approved cryptography algorithm,pretty much like those approved by NIST). We have used SM2 Homomorphic encryption, SM2 Ring Signature, SM3 Hash Function, VRF Verifiable function, Chaum-Pedersen ZKP to construct a Decentralized Secure Vote System.
